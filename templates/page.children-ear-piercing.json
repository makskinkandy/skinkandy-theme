Titanium is also hypoallergenic with no nickel or alloys, promoting faster healing. We have a large variety in store and our SkinKandy Squad can talk you through the different options to suit your child.<\/p>"

If their lobes are too small, it can cause the jewellery to be uncomfortable and cause problems with healing. It can also cause the piercings to migrate as they grow. For these reasons, if we deem earlobes to be too small, we will not pierce them.<\/p>"

In most states this certificate is not<br\/>required, but we like to set our standards high across the board! Once they hold this certificate and have a thorough understanding of our standards and values, they are put through our extensive in-house piercing training program where they are supervised by a senior piercer to perfect their technique in stages. Newbies are encouraged to increase their skillset at a pace that is suited to them to ensure they are competent and confident before being allowed to pierce unsupervised. <\/p>"

It can help to arrive 10 minutes early to your appointment to give you plenty of time to fill out these details.<\/p>"

Try letting the water from a warm shower run over your piercing to gently loosen and wash away any build up. Use your aftercare spray directly onto the site twice a day, and carefully dry the area surrounding your piercing with a clean cotton tip or make up pad - without touching the piercing site itself or the jewellery. Make sure the aftercare you have is alcohol-free<br\/>and in date. If you don’t have one already, come and grab one from us! <\/p>"
